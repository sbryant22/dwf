    	<ul>
    		<li>This is where you can view all the upcoming events in your area for your tracked artists.</li>
    		<li>The App is fully integrated with your Songkick.com account so it will scan the music from your Spotify account and add it to your Tracker in Songkick.</li>
    		<li>Likewise, any changes you make on the main Songkick site will also be reflected in Spotify.</li>
    		<li>You can easily edit the list by heading to your Tracker on Songkick.com</li>
    		<li>Clicking on a concert will give you all the information you need plus a link to the event page on Songkick so you can buy tickets.</li>
    		<li>You'll receive a daily digest email notification when new events are announced for your artists so you'll always be the first to know. <a href="file:///Users/samanthabryant/Desktop/01_Web_Fundamentals/Labs/Bryant_Samantha_lab4/linking_it_up/about.html">Source</a></li>

    <p><strong>Why am I seeing events where I can't see anyone on the list who I am tracking?</strong></p>
    <p>Most likely, this is because it's an event that has more than 8 artists on the line-up, and the ones you are tracking are hidden from view. You can check out the full listing by clicking through to see it on Songkick.com.</p>
    <p><strong>I have edited my location(s) but I'm still seeing concerts for the old location in Spotify?</strong></p>
    <p>It will take up to 15 minutes for the new concerts to be generated. <a href="mailto:contact@songkick.com">Let us know</a> if you think it's not working after this amount of time though.</p>
    <p><strong>The app started scanning my artists, but now it got stuck, what should I do?</strong><p>
    <p>If you quit Spotify and then reopen it and run the scan again it should be ok, but <a href="mailto:contact@songkick.com">drop us an email</a> if it happens repeatedly.</p>

		<ul>
    		<li>The app will import a max of 200 artists, which are generated first from your 'Top Artists'.</li>
    		<li>The rest of the artists are pulled in from your Library, which is made up of starred, imported, and playlisted tracks. We take the remaining 180 artists according to how many times that artist appears in the library.</li>
    	</ul>

    <p>If you are seeing the 'Uh Oh! Something went wrong...'message when trying to use our app on Spotify:</p>
    	<ul>
    		<li>Check that your internet connection is ok.</li>
    		<li>Try reloading the app and wait five minutes - in most cases it resolves itself.</li>
    		<li>Make sure you are not using Spotify in 'offline mode' - there should be no checkmark next to the setting.</li>
    	</ul>
