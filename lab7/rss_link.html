  		<h2>Fall Out Boy</h2>
		<p><strong>Fall Out Boy</strong> is an American pop punk band from Wilmette, Illinois. They formed the band in 2001 after being in a few other rock bands in the Chicago area. The band reached mainstream success after the release of their second album <em>From Under the Cork Tree</em> in 2005. Since then, the band has had continued success with hits like, <em>Dance, Dance</em>, <em>Thanks for the Memories</em>, <em>Save Rock and Roll</em>, and <em>My Songs Know What you Did in the Dark (Light em up)</em>. They have been topping the charts for over a decade now and they just keep getting better. I give this band 2 thumbs up.</p>
